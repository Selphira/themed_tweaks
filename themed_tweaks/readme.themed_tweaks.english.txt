-------------------------------------------------


------------------------------------------------------------------------
GENERAL
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This mod requires BG1EE, SoD, BG2EE or EET.

This mod main purpose is to augment the role-playing environment throughout the game series.  To that end, it tweaks the storyline in various places.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SoD - Give Imoen a special Wand of Magic Missiles for the attack in the palace - by Lauriel
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Imoen will drop a wand of magic missiles that will shoot up to three missiles per use to allow for her to be single class and still be able to participate in the fight as scripted.  To limit its usefulness, the wand will only be usable by her.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SoD - Allow PC to give aid to Imoen after palace attack - by Lauriel
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Allows the PC to render aid to Imoen after Caelar's elite have been defeated

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SoD - Add stat-based observations and options - by Lauriel
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adds comments about the situation and quest options based upon various stats

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SoD - Ditch tour-guide Corwin Schael - by Lauriel
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Allows the PC to wander Baldur's Gate with or without Corwin

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SoD - Scouting the Coast Way Crossing - by Lauriel
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adds a quest to scout the first bridge

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SoD/BG2 - Add a little snark - by Lauriel
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just adds some fun snarky comments to the otherwise stuffy or inane dialogue
** PROGRESS: SoD palace and Camp1 snark is finished. Only one small comment in BG2 so far

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SoD/BG2 - Remove cut scenes that the PC shouldn't be privy to - by Lauriel
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unless there's a reason for the PC to view a scene, like a scrying pool, scenes about what is happening to other NPCs outside of the PC's line-of-sight are skipped.
Note: this also removes cutscenes added by other mods, for example I4E's component "Play cutscene with Imoen and Duke Jannath".
** PROGRESS: SoD through the 1st camp is finished.  Remainder of SoD and BG2 yet to do

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SoD/BG2 - Move dreams about Irenicus from SoD to BG2 - by Lauriel
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Irenicus shouldn't have enough influence over the PC to be able to invade her dreams in SoD.  Those dreams are moved to BG2 where they will be available for other mods to play with.
** PROGRESS: SoD dreams are removed.  Still need to find appropriate spots to place them in BG2

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BG2 - Give Imoen the innate ability to cast Magic Missile - by Lauriel
------------------------------------------------------------------------
In case Imoen hasn't been dualed to a mage, she is given the innate ability to cast magic missile twice at the beginning of BG2.  A potion will be provided in Chateau Irenicus for her to use to make sure she is capable of casting it when they arrive at the promenade.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BG2 - Use movie of Irenicus in hell as dream to restore Bhaalspawn powers - by Lauriel
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This component is also a part of the Transitions mod.  Will be skipped if installed there.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

COMPATABIITY NOTES
------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are no known compatibility issues at this time

------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you're going to install Transitions or Endless BG1, do so before Themed Tweaks.

Installation using Project Infinity (https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/74335/project-infinity-mod-manager-for-baldurs-gate-icewind-dale-planescape-torment-and-eet) will ensure this and other mods are installed in the correct order.

NOTE: If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting a new version. To do this, uninstall all previously installed components and delete the mod folder and executables. 

When installing or uninstalling, do not close the DOS window by clicking on the X button! Instead, press the Enter key when instructed to do so.

IMPORTANT FOR EET INSTALLATIONS: EET_End will need to be reinstalled after installing this mod.
 
General (Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux)

Extract the contents of the mod archive to your game's main directory. 

Windows
On successful extraction, there should be a themed_tweaks folder and a setup-themed_tweaks.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click setup-themed_tweaks.exe and follow the instructions on screen.
Run setup-themed_tweaks.exe in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.

Mac OS X
The mod is packaged and installed with WeiDU. To install, extract the mod archive, then copy of the contents of the folder into your game folder (the folder which contains the CHITIN.KEY file). If properly extracted, you should have a "themed_tweaks" folder, setup-themed_tweaks, and setup-themed_tweaks.command in your game folder. To install, simply double-click setup-themed_tweaks.command and follow the instructions on screen.

Linux
Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify. Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal and cd to your EET installation directory, run 'tolower' and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already run it once in the same directory. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safest bet.
Run WeInstall themed_tweaks in your game folder to install the mod. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing. 

If you have installation problems or encounter any bugs, please post your bug report in the forum thread: https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/32346-themed-tweaks-for-bgee-sod-bg2ee-tob-eet.
